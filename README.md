- Please use the 'www' subfolder for development.
- Please commit all changes to the 'dev_branch' and NOT directly to master. We will always test/check our committed code in the 'dev_branch' and once we can be sure it is ready to be pushed to master, we then can.
- DO NOT commit any changes made (which should be none) outside of the 'www' subfolder.
