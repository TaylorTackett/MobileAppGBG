- Please select the "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request. Learn more about pull requests." and NOT "Commit directly to master." We will always test/check our committed code in a different branch and not in the master, that way we can be sure it is ready to be pushed to master.
- The master branch should always only contain PRODUCTION ready code.

- Please use the 'www' subfolder for development.
- DO NOT commit any changes made (which should be none) outside of the 'www' subfolder.
